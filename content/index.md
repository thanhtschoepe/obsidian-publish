Welcome! I'm **Th√†nh** (pronounced like "than"), a software engineer with nearly 8 years of experience crafting digital solutions. My name, of Vietnamese origin, means "success" - a fitting coincidence for my chosen path.

Currently, I'm building the front-end of **HubSpot's CRM Index Page**, collaborating with an exceptional team of engineers who inspire me daily. HubSpot's culture of innovation and growth has made it more than just a workplace - it's where great minds come together to solve meaningful problems.

Through this blog, I'll share insights from my engineering journey, exploring topics I'm passionate about and offering perspectives that I hope will resonate with fellow developers. Whether you're here for technical deep-dives or industry observations, I aim to make each post valuable for your own professional growth.

*Side note: If you're a developer looking for your next opportunity, I'd encourage you to explore [HubSpot's career page](https://www.hubspot.com/careers). The talent and culture here are truly exceptional.*
