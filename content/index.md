# Hello world

Welcome to my (in development) blog. Here you can find my random thoughts, or just listening to something I care passionately about.

I'm a **software engineer**, but you can probably guess that from the font choice ðŸ¤£.

I've been wrangling with code for **almost 8 years now**, and I have stories to tell from my long journey. I hope I'll be able to bring you some perspective and help with my journey in this craft.

My current role is at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/careers). I work on the front-end of the **index page** for the **CRM**. HubSpot is seriously an awesome place where amazingly talented folks work and stay for the long time. Shameless plug but to you readers who are fellow devs, checkout our career pages.

A little bit about my name. It's **ThÃ nh** and it's of Vietnamese origin. The one with the downward tone means "success". It's typically pronounced like **thank**, but without the k sound at the end.
